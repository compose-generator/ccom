# Introduction
CCom is a language that allows you to define conditional sections in common data formats, which do not allow logic by default. It acts like a pre-processor and can evaluate your conditional expressions, based on a JSON data object that you can pass to CCom alongside an input file. In order to get started, visit our [quick-start guide](../quick-start).

Here you can see a demo, how to use CCom to process a YAML data file with conditional sections:
