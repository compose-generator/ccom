# Introduction
CCom is a language for having the possiblity to define conditional sections in common data formats, which do not allow logic by default. It acts like a pre-processor and can evaluate the conditional expressions, defined by you, based on a JSON data object, which you can pass to CCom along with the input file. <br>
To get started with CCom, visit our [quick-start guide](../quick-start).

Here you can see a demo, how to use CCom to process a YAML data file with conditional sections:
