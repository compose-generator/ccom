# Introduction
CCom is a language that allows you to define conditional sections in common data formats, which do not allow logic by default. It acts like a pre-processor and can evaluate your conditional expressions, based on a JSON data object that you can pass to CCom alongside an input file. In order to get started, visit our [usage guide](../usage).
