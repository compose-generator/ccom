# CCom (Conditional Comments) language

*Note: This language is part of the Compose Generator project, but also can be used independently.*

## Introduction
CCom is a language for pre-processing source files. It's primary purpose is to evaluate conditional sections in formats like YAML or JSON, but can also be used for a variety of programming languages with support for comments.

### Input
CCom requests two input parameters. A source file/string of any language, containing conditional sections and a JSON file/string, which holds data for the evaluation and some configuration for CCom.

#### Source file
Here is an example YAML file, which can be evaluated by CCom:
```yaml
...
property1: "value1"
#! if has service.angular | has service.mysql {
#! property2:
#! 	property3: true
#! }
...
```

Another example for Java (whatever you want to achive with that)
```java
public class Example {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
        //! if has property_name {
        //! System.out.println("True");
        //! }
		//! if not has property_name {
        //! System.out.println("False");
        //! }
	}
}
```

#### Data input
```json
{
    "comment-char": "#",
    "delete-comments-on-false": true,
    "data": {
        "version": "0.7.0",
        "service": {
            "frontend": [
                {
                    "label": "Spring Maven",
                    "name": "spring-maven",
                    "dir": "./spring-maven",
                    "type": "frontend",
                    "preselected": false
                },
                {
                    "label": "Spring Gradle",
                    "name": "spring-gradle",
                    "dir": "./spring-gradle",
                    "type": "frontend",
                    "preselected": false
                }
            ],
            "backend": []
        },
        "var": [
            {
                "name": "SPRING_MAVEN_SOURCE_DIRECTORY",
                "value": "./backend"
            },
            {
                "name": "SPRING_MAVEN_PACKAGE_NAME",
                "value": "com.chillibits.test-app"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Single condition + data input => boolean output
You also have the option to feed CCom with a single condition and get a boolean output, whether this condition is true or false.
```ccom
has service.angular | has service.mysql | has backend
```

In combination with the data input from above, this condition would be `false`, because the data collection does not fulfill any of the three sub-conditions.

## Grammar
```
SECTION    --> #! if STMT_LST {\nPAYLOAD\n#! }
PAYLOAD    --> #! SOMETHING\nPAYLOAD | #! SOMETHING
STMT_LST   --> STMT `|` STMT_LST | STMT
STMT       --> HAS_STMT | VAR_STMT
HAS_STMT   --> has KEY | not has KEY
VAR_STMT   --> KEY == VALUE | KEY != VALUE
KEY        --> IDENTIFIER.KEY | IDENTIFIER
IDENTIFIER --> CHAR IDENTIFIER | CHAR
VALUE      --> STRING | NUMBER
STRING     --> "SOMETHING"
NUMBER     --> DIGIT NUMBER | DIGIT
SOMETHING  --> CHAR SOMETHING | DIGIT SOMETHING | SCHAR SOMETHING | CHAR | DIGIT | SCHAR
CHAR       --> a|b|...|y|z|A|B|...|Y|Z
DIGIT      --> 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9
SCHAR      --> -|.|_|[|]|{|}
```

## Keywords
-   `if`
-   `has`

## Special characters
-   `!`
-   `|`
-   `.`
-   `"`
-   `{` / `}`

## Work process
The first thing CCom does is to analyze the input and determine, whether it is a single condition or a source file.

### Source file
CCom takes only the individual conditional sections and feeds them into the interpreter one by one, starting by the `SECTION` grammar node. <br>
So, one input to the `SECTION` node can look like this:

```yaml
#! if has frontend | has service.backend-flask | var.FLASK_PORT == 8080 {
#! - attribute
#! - attribute2
#! } 
```

### Single condition
CCom feeds the condition into the interpreter, starting by the `STMT` grammar node.
